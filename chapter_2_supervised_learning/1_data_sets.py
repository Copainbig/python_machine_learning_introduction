"""
Supervised learning is used whenever you want to predict a certain outcome from a 
given input, and you have examples of input/output pairs.

The model, trained on known data, should be able to generalize on unknown data.

There are 2 major types of supervised machine learning problems :
- classification : predict a label out of a list of possibilities (iris species problem).
- regression : predict a continuous number (salary out of age, studies, country).


Beware to not fit a model too closely to the particularities of a training set model. Chances
are that it would generalize poorly. It is called 'overfitting'. Choosing a too simple model 
is called 'underfitting'.

**Data Set Characteristics:**

    :Number of Instances: 569

    :Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

    :Attribute Information:
        - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
        - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
        - perimeter
        - area
        - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
        - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
        - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
        - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
        - symmetry
        - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

        The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
        worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
        resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field
        10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Separating plane described above was obtained using
Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree
Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th
Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets",
Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
